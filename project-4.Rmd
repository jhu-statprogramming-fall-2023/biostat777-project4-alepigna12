**What is the purpose of this dashboard?**

<hr>

This dashboard has two purposes: (1) to explore trends among FIFA World Cups (from Uruguay 1930 to Qatar 2020), and (2) to practice building dashboards with `R`.

<hr>

###

**Data Source**

<hr>

This dashboard uses the [Football - FIFA World Cup, 1930 - 2022 data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/piterfm/fifa-football-world-cup), put together on Kaggle by [Petro](https://www.kaggle.com/piterfm).

### Data Description
This dashboard uses data from the football (soccer) World Cups 1930-2020 uploaded to this Kaggle [`Kaggle webpage](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/piterfm/fifa-football-world-cup) by [Petro](https://www.kaggle.com/piterfm). There are three datasets:

-   fifa_ranking_2022-10-06.csv contains teams ranking before Qatar 2022 World Cup.

-   matches_1930_2022.csv contains all match results from 1930 to 2022.

-   world_cup.csv includes summary information about each World Cup.

More datils above each dataset can be found at the following links: [Fifa Rankings before Qatar 2022](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/piterfm/fifa-football-world-cup?select=fifa_ranking_2022-10-06.csv), [Matches History](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/piterfm/fifa-football-world-cup?select=matches_1930_2022.csv), [World Cups Summary](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/piterfm/fifa-football-world-cup?select=world_cup.csv)

# Analysis {data-icon="fa-chart-line"}

## Column {data-height=100}

**Question: has scoring at the World Cup gotten harder over the years?**

At the last soccer world cup (Qatar 2022), French Kylian Mbappé was the top scorer with 8 goals in 7 games. To find a better performance, we need to look back to German Gerd Müller who scored 10 goals in only 6 games in 1970. The all-time goalscorer in a single edition is Just Fontaine who scored 13 goals in 6 games in 1958. His record has stood for 16 editions and nobody has even come close. Why? Has scoring gotten harder because of an increase attention to defensive tactics?

**Data Visualization**
```{r}
goals_per_game <- matches %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarise(GoalsPerGame = sum(home_score + away_score) / n())

# Create a bar plot
renderPlot({ggplot(goals_per_game, aes(x = Year, y = GoalsPerGame)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue") +
  labs(title = "Goals Per Game in World Cup Matches",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Goals Per Game",
       caption = "Data Source: World Cup Matches") +
  theme_minimal()
})
```

**Linear Regression**
```{r}
linear_model <- lm(GoalsPerGame ~ Year, data = goals_per_game)

renderPrint({
  summary(linear_model)
})

renderPlot({ggplot(goals_per_game, aes(x = Year, y = GoalsPerGame)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Scatter Plot with Line of Best Fit",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Goals Per Game",
       caption = "Data Source: World Cup Matches") +
  theme_minimal()
})
```

**Spline**

While linear regression shows a negatively sloped line of best-fit with a significant coefficient, when we look at the scatterplot vs best-fit line we can tell that the line doesn't actually do a great job at fitting the data. In particular, it seems that the goals per game were initially increasing before the Second World War, then they satrted decreasing as World Cup resumed until 1970, after which they appear to be fluctuating around similar values. Let us see if this trend can be captured with a spline with cutoff years 1950 and 1970.

```{r}
library(multcomp)
# Create appropriate variables 
goals_per_game <- goals_per_game %>%
  mutate(X2 = case_when(Year - 1950 > 0 ~ Year - 1950, TRUE ~ 0),
         X3 = case_when(Year - 1970 > 0 ~ Year - 1970, TRUE ~ 0))

# Implement spline
spline_model <- lm(GoalsPerGame ~ Year + X2 + X3, data = goals_per_game)

# Extract coefficients
b0 <- coef(spline_model)[1]
b1 <- coef(spline_model)[2]
b2 <- coef(spline_model)[3]
b3 <- coef(spline_model)[4]

# Testing for the slope after 1970
hyp <- glht(spline_model, linfct = "Year + X2 + X3 = 0")

# Print hypothesis test results
renderPrint({summary(hyp)})


# Calculate predictions
goals_per_game$predicted <- b0 + b1 * goals_per_game$Year + b2 * goals_per_game$X2 + b3 * goals_per_game$X3


# Create scatter plot with the fitted line using ggplot2
renderPlot({ggplot(goals_per_game, aes(x = Year, y = GoalsPerGame)) +
  geom_point() +
    geom_line(data = goals_per_game, aes(x = Year, y = predicted), color = "purple") +
  
  # Add titles and labels
  ggtitle("Spline of Goals Per Game Over the Years") +
  labs(subtitle = "Broken-line with cutoff points in 1950 and 1970",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Goals Per Game") +
  
  # Add a caption
  labs(caption = "After 1970, goals per game have not signigicantly decreased at World Cups") +
  
  # Customize theme if needed
  theme_minimal()
})
```
From our analysis, it appears that while it has gotten harder to score at World Cups compared to very early editions, on average scoring difficulty has not changed much since 1970. 

**Scatterplot with Confidence Interval**
Now, let us produce some more visualization to see if the confidence interval of the average goals per game at the World Cup has changed since 1970.
```{r}
total_goals <- dplyr::select(matches, Year, home_score, away_score)
total_goals <- total_goals %>%
  filter(Year >= 1970) %>%
  mutate(total_goals = home_score + away_score) 

# Calculate confidence intervals using base R functions
confidence_intervals <- total_goals %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarise(mean_goals = mean(total_goals),
            sd_goals = sd(total_goals),
            n_goals = n()) %>%
  mutate(lower_bound = mean_goals - 1.96 * (sd_goals / sqrt(n_goals)),
         upper_bound = mean_goals + 1.96 * (sd_goals / sqrt(n_goals)))

# Calculate average goals for each year
average_goals <- total_goals %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarise(average_goals = mean(total_goals))

# Merge average_goals with confidence_intervals
plot_data <- left_join(average_goals, confidence_intervals, by = "Year")

# Plotting

renderPlot({ggplot(plot_data, aes(x = Year, y = average_goals)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lower_bound, ymax = upper_bound), width = 0.2) +
  labs(title = "Average Goals per World Cup Game with confidence interval",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Average Goals")
})
```
